- 👋 Hi, I’m @Matsuyoi14
- 👀 I’m interested in making software and doing translation projects.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C# through the use of Visual Studio and have had prior experience with Python, Java and React/React Native.
- 💞️ I’m not looking to collaborate on anything in particular at the moment.
- 📫 You'll have my contact details if I've already given them to you in person or though a CV in an application.
